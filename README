Program structure:
The main program is composed of the modules Eval.py, Logic.py, Parse.py and Lex.py dealing with the evaluation logic.
The test class Test.py can be used for unit testing the program.
Main.py runs and prints the problem solutions.

Running Main.py:
Execute the following command in the Terminal (preferably one that supports Unicode characters):

    python3 Main.py

Platform:
Run on any OS that allows Python 3 to be installed. I myself tested the program on Linux, but OSX and Windows should also work just fine.
