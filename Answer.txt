Quesion in Problem 4.1:
Given A |= B
When solving the problems with pen and paper we try to find models seperately for each side of the equation. We then check if the set of all models of A is contained in the set of all models of B. If it is the entailmend holds.

In contrast, when running the program we combine both formulas using theorem 3.1 or 3.2 and check those for a certain trait. E.g. using theorem 3.2. we use the formula A => B and check for a tautology. Iff this assumtion holds, the entailment also holds.

Question in Problem 4.2.3:
The answers to B and C match the pen and paper solution.

If we query the KB for A or ~A we get false in both cases, which mean that the KB can neither entail A or ~A. This also means that the KB can not decide what A is. The pen and paper solution also makes no statement whether A is a kight or a knave.

KB |/= A, then it must be that KB |= ¬A ?
    kb |/= A => kb |= ~A

    Using the definition in theorem 3.1 we get:
    ~ (kb /\ ~A) => (kb /\ A) must be valid, which must be valid
    (for all combinations(kb, A) both sides must evaluate to be false, and false => false is valid)

However the formula turns out to not be valid (using our program :) see Test.py test_questoin423) which means the statement (KB |/= A, then it must be that KB |= ¬A) is wrong.
